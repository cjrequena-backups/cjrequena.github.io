## **Summary** ##
This reference document shows the logging best practice for java

## **Description** ##
Logging subsystem provides facilities for capturing, recording and reporting events which occur within the OpenDaylight system. These events are the primary means of system diagnostics and troubleshooting, serving a wide audience including automated monitoring systems, operators, administrators, support personnel and development engineers.

In order to provide a 'single system' experience, all software components should follow same basic rules for interfacing with the logging system. While it is not practical to force these rules on the various third parties, they should to be followed by all newly-developed components.
